# Harness Nexus — server image.
#
# Multi-stage build:
#   - `build`    installs all deps (+ toolchain for better-sqlite3), compiles TS,
#                and runs `pnpm deploy` to extract a self-contained, prod-only
#                server directory with workspace symlinks dereferenced.
#   - `runtime`  ships only that directory + the data volume. No source, no
#                devDeps, no compilers.
#
# Base is Debian slim (glibc), NOT alpine: @node-rs/argon2 and better-sqlite3
# ship/built napi binaries against glibc. Switching to alpine would force musl
# rebuilds of both.
