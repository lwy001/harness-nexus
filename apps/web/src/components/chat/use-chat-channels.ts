 * 9 W11 B — the user's live-channel snapshot, kept current by the server's
 * `chat:channels` pushes (initial truth arrives on /app connect; every table
 * change re-pushes). Mount wherever channel truth is rendered (the tab bar on
 * both chat pages) — multiple mounts share the one /app socket harmlessly.
 *
 * MOUNT also syncs: the connect-time push predates this mount whenever the
 * SPA navigated (the socket survives navigation), so the hook asks for the
 * current snapshot once via `chat:channels.sync` instead of waiting for the
 * next table change to learn the truth.
