/**
 * A Credential is a reusable named secret that AgentNexus injects into an MCP
 * transport at resolve time. It is referenced by name via a `${cred:NAME}`
 * placeholder inside transport string fields (url, command, args, env values,
 * header values); the placeholder is replaced with the decrypted plaintext when
 * the connection is opened (proxy mode) or at install time (direct mode).
 *
 * This is distinct from PersonalAccessToken, which authenticates a user *into*
 * AgentNexus. A Credential authenticates AgentNexus *out to* a third party.
 *
 * The `secret` field holds AES-256-GCM ciphertext (see server crypto module);
 * the plaintext is never returned by the API (responses carry a masked
 * preview instead). See docs/design/phase-2.1-credentials.md.
