/**
 * Credential placeholder interpolation.
 *
 * A credential's secret is referenced by name via `${cred:NAME}` inside
 * transport string fields (url, command, args, env values, header values).
 * `resolvePlaceholders` scans a string for these tokens and substitutes the
 * value returned by `lookup(name)`. The lookup is expected to decrypt the
 * credential and return its plaintext; an unknown name lets the lookup throw,
 * which surfaces as a connection error (proxy) / install error (direct).
 *
 * Resolution timing:
 *   - proxy mode  — server-side at connect time (plaintext in memory only).
 *   - direct mode — install time, by the Phase 3.3 writer.
 *
 * See docs/design/phase-2.1-credentials.md.
