/**
 * Profile version auto-numbering (2026-09, agreed with the user):
 *
 * - Versions are server-assigned; the manual field is gone from the UI and the
 *   client-sent value is ignored.
 * - New profiles start at `0.1`.
 * - Digits are DECIMAL and each segment carries at 16: `0.1` … `0.15` →
 *   `1.0`. All-decimal keeps every generated version valid semver, which
 *   Claude Code's `plugin update` version comparison relies on (strict
 *   hexadecimal — `0.a` … `0.f` — was rejected for exactly that risk).
 * - A version bumps ONLY when the profile's entries change: name/description
 *   edits keep the version so installed machines don't pointlessly update
 *   (the bump is the marketplace publish switch).
 *
 * Legacy hand-typed versions (`1.0.0`, `0.3.2`, …) keep their shape; the
 * increment applies to the last segment with the same carry-at-16 rule.
